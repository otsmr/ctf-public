It's time again for a new cipher. The cipher is based on the Feistel network with two rounds. Break the Feistel cipher with a chosen ciphertext attack!

Let's go: nc localhost 7795

Since this is a secure cipher, the complete encryption algorithm is of course also open-source according to the Kerckhoffs's principle. See download below.
