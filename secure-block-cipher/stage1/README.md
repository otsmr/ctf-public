It's time for a new secure block cipher.

To ensure security this block cipher consists of:

    16 rounds with 16 different permutations
    80 bit key length: So 2^80 possible keys for a brute force attack.

Since this is a secure block cipher, the complete encryption algorithm is of course also open-source according to the Kerckhoffs's principle. See download below.

Can you crack the encryption algorithm? Then here is your flag: 717A488EA41B620DE05E83724BE0AE60740C22F6C27403EABE803042C056527807C4FE2A004
